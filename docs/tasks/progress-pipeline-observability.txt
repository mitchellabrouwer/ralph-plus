## Codebase Patterns

1. **bats test structural assertions**: Use `declare -f` to inspect function body for structural assertions. Example: `declare -f main_loop | grep -q "UP)"` verifies that a specific case branch exists in the function definition without needing to execute the function.

2. **shellcheck quality bar**: `--severity=warning` is the effective quality gate for bash code. Info and style findings are pre-existing and not blockers. Focus linting on warnings and errors only.

## 2026-02-16 - US-001: Remove arrow key handling from dashboard

- Removed all arrow key case branches (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) from four main loops: main_loop, multi_task_loop, story_detail_loop, and log_loop
- The read_key function continues to consume escape sequences to prevent garbage output, but returned escape code values now fall through unmatched to the caller
- Updated all help text across multiple screens to show only j/k/h/l/Enter navigation keys
- Added 10 new bats tests (tests 33-42) to verify arrow key removal and that j/k/h/l/Enter still work correctly
- Files changed: ralph-plus/dashboard.sh, tests/dashboard.bats
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - bats test structural assertions can use `declare -f` to inspect function body for case branch existence
  - shellcheck at --severity=warning is the effective quality bar for shell scripts (info/style findings are pre-existing)
  - Consuming escape sequences in read_key prevents garbage output even when cases are not matched
